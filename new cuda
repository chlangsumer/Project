________First Method_____________
Uninstall All NVIDIA Graphics Driver in Setting -> Apps & Features and
Delete NVIDIA folders on both Program Files present in C Drive
Check Tensorflow GPU compatibility

Installation Process:
1. Install VC_redist.x64
2. CUDA
3. Copy files cuDNN & paste to CUDA  Computing Toolkit file
4. Install TensorFlow with version you want
5. Go to Website Use a GPU to check the GPU detection using jupyter notebook


***************Second****************
Steps:

1. Uninstall all NVIDIA Drivers/Software and delete all NVIDIA files from program files (x86 aswell)

2. Install Visual Studio 2017 (from link above)

3. Install CUDA (first check compatible versions using link above)

4. Download cuDNN (again check version is same as CUDA version)

5. Extract the cuDNN zip folder to your desktop. Open a new windows explorer and navigate to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\Vx.x\ . Now copy the contents of the downloaded and extracted cuDNN folder into the appropriate folders (files from cuDNN bin go into the new windows explorer bin folder etc.).

6. Navigate to your system enviorment variables and edit the path. Add the following two directories into your path:
-  C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\bin
- C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\libnvvp

7. Download and Install Anaconda (from link above)

8. Set up a virtual enviorment using python 3.5
- conda create -n [name] python=3.5

9. Activate the virtual enviorment
- activate [name]

10. Install packages
- pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
- pip install keras
- pip install pandas (optional)
- pip install numpy (optional)
